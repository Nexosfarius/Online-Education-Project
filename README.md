# Online-Education-Project

This project is a clone of a project I did with a fellow SJU student named Zeyu Pan over the fall of 2022. The original project is hosted in Bitbucket with this repo link:

TYhe focus of this project was to create a demo online school system where the users would be students and teachers. The teachers would be able to create classes which would be able to hold any assignments the teachers created. The classes themselves would be held in a course catalogue where the students would be able to view the courses and add the courses to their course list. Once this was done, the course would hold the student object in a list which would allows teachers and students to both coordinate through the catalogue which courses they are in. The catalogue was a singleton which made sure that all updates made by the teacher or student would be done for all students and classes which allowed for the data to stay updated.
